// add help paragraphs
$formface .= addParagraph('Enter your username and password to log into your Resume Builder account. If you don\'t have a Resume Builder account, then go to the'

// add help paragraphs
$formface .= addParagraph('In order to use the resume builder, fill out all of the fields in the contact information, position sought, and employment history pages. '
	. 'Then, view the finished resume! To navigate around the site, use the footer bar located at the bottom of each page.');

$formface .= addParagraph('For example, to complete the contact information section, just click on the second icon captioned "Contact Information" to open the form. '
	. 'In order to return to the index page, click the first icon, captioned "Index". To start over on a new resume, click the "Start New Resume" icon in the bottom '
	. 'right corner, but be warned: your existing resume information will be erased.');

// add save/load section
$formface .= addSubheading('Saving to and Loading from the Database');

// add help paragraphs
$formface .= addParagraph('Click on the save icon in the footer menu to be taken to the Save/Load page. Clicking the Save button on that page will save all session resume'
	. ' information to the database. Clicking the Load button after selecting an existing resume will load that resume\'s information into the session. You can also preview'
	. ' a resume by selecting it, and clicking the Preview button. Doing so will not alter the session data.');

// add technical details v2 section heading
$formface .= addHeading('Technical Details v2.0');

// add validation section
$formface .= addSubheading('Validation');
$formface .= addParagraph('Validation is mostly the same as in the original version, except that some checking has been added to enforce YYYY-MM-DD formatting of dates.'
	. ' This was done via applying a regular expression (^\d\d\d\d-\d\d?-\d\d?$) in both PHP and JavaScript. It ensures the format is correct, but does not ensure that'
	. ' the month is less than 13, or that the day is less than 30, 31, or 29 (depending on month). In the case that a correctly-formatted but invalid date (i.e. 2003-44-86)'
	. ' is submitted, the database will save it as 0000-00-00.');

// add security section
$formface .= addSubheading('Security');
$formface .= addParagraph('HTTPS was not used, because we haven\'t learned about it yet. However, each resume is tied to a user account, and each user can only see their'
	. ' resumes. The passwords are stored using a SHA256 hash salted with the username. Even though this is an easy-to-guess salting scheme, it still makes rainbow table'
	. ' use impossible, because the rainbow table would have to enumerate not only the passwords, but each version of a password salted with every possible username. The'
	. ' passwords are only stored as hashes, so there is no risk of mass password loss.');

// add database section
$formface .= addSubheading('Database Information');
$formface .= addParagraph('The database schema has been significantly modified from last week\'s submission by making changes the grader suggested. In addition, contact'
	. ' information is specific to each resume rather than specific to each user account. The SQL used also is now in the form of PDO prepared statements, as opposed to'
	. ' the stored procedures created for last week. User input is sanitized by using PHP\'s bindParam to assign each piece of query data.');

// add php objects section
$formface .= addSubheading('PHP Objects');
$formface .= addParagraph('All database interactions were encapsulated in the DatabaseBackend class. Wrapper functions were used in sql_functions.php to avoid having to'
	. ' connect to the database immediately upon loading a page, unless it is necessary for the load. Instead, the database object (and connection) are created when needed'
	. ' (lazy initialization) and destroyed once they are no longer needed (when the wrapper function ends).');

// add technical details v1 heading
$formface .= addHeading('Technical Details v1.0');

// add validation section
$formface .= addSubheading('Validation');
$formface .= addParagraph('Because fields such as names vary widely, and the user should have a good deal of control over how the end product looks, validation is '
	. 'mostly confined to seeing which fields are completely empty. It is done in two parts: the on-page validation is done with JavaScript, and the conversion from '
	. 'POST variables to Session variables is done by PHP functions. The JavaScript informs the user of any empty fields and highlights them, while the PHP functions '
	. 'check for the existence of all necessary variables. Since we don\'t really care what\'s in them from a variable storage standpoint, people could fake them via '
	. 'spoofed POST headers, but since they can enter anything they want anyway, there isn\'t much point to it. The PHP does check if all variables are there before '
	. 'allowing them to be saved as session variables; if someone is going to spoof a POST, it makes sure that they at least have the decency to cover all fields.');

// add resume section
$formface .= addSubheading('Building the Resume');
$formface .= addParagraph('All incoming variables are checked for existence before use, allowing the user to see partially-completed resumes in all their half-finished '
	. 'glory. I styled the resume after the one I used to get my current job. It\'s not exactly the same, but it looks close.');

// add footer section
$formface .= addSubheading('The Floating Footer');
$formface .= addParagraph('The footer took a lot of styling to get to work correctly. It uses fixed positioning to put itself at the bottom of the page, and uses '
	. 'table-cell divs for each icon in order to control spacing. There is an invisible spacer div behind it to make sure the form face doesn\'t get pushed underneath. '
	. 'The final product doesn\'t gum up scrolling when the page is very tall (as in the case of the employment history page).');

// add template section
$formface .= addSubheading('Generating HTML');
$formface .= addParagraph('All of the pages are based on PHP templates. The form pages themselves just build a form face string and then send it to the template to be '
	. 'output. The advantage of this is that it would allow a visual redesign of the site very easily; just change the templates and you\'re done! I also relied '
	. 'heavily on PHP functions and JavaScript functions to build page elements for me. The end result is a much cleaner separation of model (form inputs), view (CSS '
	. 'and PHP templates), and controller (PHP and JavaScript functions). Especially since we have to use this site as a baseline for the next few weeks\' assignments, '
	. 'I\'m glad that I did it this way.');

// add remove buttons section
$formface .= addSubheading('"Remove Section" Buttons');
$formface .= addParagraph('I\'m particularly happy with the Remove Section buttons on the employment history page. It was initially a pain to keep track of what indices '
	. 'were available to use, and would sometimes have multiple divs with the same ID, until the idea hit me to just increment the index endlessly, like we would in a '
	. 'database autoincrementing primary key. This took the addSection function\'s index finder from O(N) to O(1) (not that it really matters with so few employment history '
	. 'entries), and since the backend handles the variable array, there is no later cost to ordering the elements into the POST array. The most important part, though, is '
	. 'that it\'s much less buggy, and is easier to understand and maintain.');
